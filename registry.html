      <p>Rather than fill our small apartment with nic-nacs, we've opted to create a registry to fund our honeymoon. Where are we going? South Korea. It's not your typical honeymoon destination, but it's a beautiful country that doesn't get enough credit.</p>

            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 1-3</span>Seoul</h4>
            <p>Check out the fun and funky sights of Seoul! This includes beautiful palaces and temples, gamer cafes, cat cafes, Kpop concerts, hazy Soju nights with weird salarymen, Korean baseball games, yummy street food, upscale restaurant food, market food (basically, all the food) and lots, lots more.</p>

            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 4</span>Bukhansan</h4>
            <p>Day trip out to Bukhansan National Park, the mountain range right next to Seoul.</p>

         <li>
          <div>
            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 5</span>The DMZ</h4>
            <p>Day trip out to the Demilitarized Zone - or the DMZ. Because nothing quite sets the mood like an unresolved civil war!</p>
          </div>
        </li>
         <li>
          <div>
            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 6</span>Gyeongju</h4>
            <p>Take the bullet train down to a small village called Gyeongju. Stay at a local guesthouse run by a Korean family. Explore the quirks of a tiny, traditional town.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
         <li>
          <div>
            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 7-9</span>Busan</h4>
            <p>Take a bus to Busan, one of South Korea's largest cities with a whopping 4 million residents. Walk along the beautiful coast one day, hike up some awesome mountains the next. Take a day trip out to explore nearby Gamcheon (known locally as the "colorful village").</p>
          </div>
        </li>
         <li>
          <div>
            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 10-13</span>Jeju Island</h4>
            <p>Fly from Busan to Jeju Island. Or, as Koreans call it: "honeymoon island" (how fitting!). There, we'll hike Hallasan (the tallest mountain in the country), laze around on Hamdeok Beach, and generally do the actual honeymoon thing!</p>

            <h4><span class="allcaps">Day 14</span>Back Home</h4>
            <p>Fly back to Seoul and catch a flight back to Washington, DC. Tear, tear, sigh...</p>
