        <h3><span class="allcaps">August, 2008</span>Talybont-On-Usk Wales, UK</h3>
        <p>After months of flirty, far-too-thought-out text messages over touchtone Nokias, Janet and Scott go on their first hiking adventure together. They decide they're kinda into each other after a bike ride that neither would admit was over their heads and a €5 box of charming J.P. Chenet. BUT ONE PROBLEM! A week later, Scott heads back to Boston for his senior year of college while Janet stays in the UK…</p>

        <h3><span class="allcaps">September, 2009</span>London, UK</h3>
        <p>Huzzah! Reunited at last! After a year of trans-Atlantic skyping, texting through peekamo (before iMessage even existed!) and cheeky jaunts over the pond, Scott moves to South London (innit) for a job and Janet gets into a master's program in East London. Janet lives with friends and Scott moves in with his pal Russell. Cue loads of (real life!) date nights, a couple of RyanAir rendez-vous and plenty of adventures in between.</p>

        <h3><span class="allcaps">March, 2012</span>Washington, DC USA</h3>
        <p>After two and a half years of European galavanting, Janet’s UK working visa ends. But the show must go on! The pair pack their bags, have a blow-out party at Euston Taps and make the fateful move to Washington, DC with one-way tickets in hand. Then, the real party begins: rebuilding their new lives on foreign - yet not so foreign - soil. A few months later, this little critter finds her way to P Street and shacks up with them...</p>

        <p>DUN DUN DUN… IT HAPPENS! After trekking miles upon miles up to Lake Yunoko in Japan’s Nikko National Park, Scott pops the big Q on a little bridge overlooking the water surrounded by beautiful foliage. They’re so excited, they nearly miss the last bus back to the train station!</p>
